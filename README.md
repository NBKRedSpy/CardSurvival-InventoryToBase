# Inventory to Base

Allows the user to move items from a container directly to the base.
This is similar to the "Take out all items" button, but the user can chose single items.

To use, hold the Shift key while moving cards from a container or the character's equipped items.  

A container is a satchel, bag, basket, etc.

# Installation 
This mod requires the BepInEx mod loader.

## BepInEx Setup
If BepInEx has already been installed, skip this section.

Download BepInEx from https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.21/BepInEx_x64_5.4.21.0.zip

* Extract the contents of the BepInEx zip file into the game's directory:
```<Steam Directory>\steamapps\common\Card Survival Tropical Island```

    __Important__:  The .zip file *must* be extracted to the root folder of the game.  If BepInEx was extracted correctly, the following directory will exist: ```<Steam Directory>\steamapps\common\Card Survival Tropical Island\BepInEx```.  This is a common install issue.

* Run the game.  Once the main menu is shown, exit the game.
    
* In the BepInEx folder, there will now be a "plugins" directory.

    * Otherwise, download from https://github.com/NBKRedSpy/CardSurvival-InventoryToBase/releases/

* Extract the contents of the zip file into the ```BepInEx/plugins``` folder.
